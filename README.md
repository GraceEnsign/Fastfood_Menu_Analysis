<p align="center"><h2>Fastfood Menu Analysis</h2></p> 

  

<h3>Project Description</h3> 

Comparing the average calories in four perceived unhealthy fastfood restaurants (McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, and Wendys) to the average calories of a perceived healthy fast casual restaurant (Panera Bread). Each menu's nutrition information was obtained, and this project will focus primarily on the menu's calories and macronutrients (fats, carbohydrates, and protein) percentages. I have acquired the number of items on each menu, the highest calorie item as well as the lowest calorie item, the average calories of each menu, and the total percentage of macronutrients. Analysis created to aid in the question: Is the perceived healthy restaurant really the healthier option?
